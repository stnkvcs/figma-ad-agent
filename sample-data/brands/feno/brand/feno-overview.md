# Feno Company Overview

## Company Mission
After seeing the direct link between oral health and diseases like cancer and heart disease, Feno's founder couldn't stand by while otherwise healthy people developed life-threatening conditions in part because of their poor oral health. Feno's mission is to equip every home with advanced oral health technology that transforms daily routines into comprehensive health monitoring systems, helping people live better and longer by preventing systemic diseases before they start.

## The Problem Feno Solves

### Poor Oral Health Leading to Systemic Disease
- **Key statistics and data points:** 90% of individuals suffer from some form of gum disease; poor oral health is directly linked to heart disease, diabetes, and cancer
- **Specific pain points addressed:**
  - Gum disease prevalence and lack of early detection
  - Oral health complications leading to heart disease, diabetes, and cancer
  - Inability to monitor oral health at home between dental visits
  - Lack of connection between daily oral care and overall health outcomes
- **Target audience struggles:** Health-conscious individuals want to optimize wellness but lack tools to monitor oral health, understand its connection to systemic health, or catch problems early before they require expensive dental interventions

### Time Scarcity and Inconsistent Technique
- **Additional problems solved:** Traditional brushing requires 2 minutes twice daily (21 hours per year) and relies on proper technique, which most people don't execute consistently. Feno reduces brushing time to 20 seconds while eliminating human error through full-mouth simultaneous coverage.

## Market Landscape

### Target Audience
- **Primary:** Health-conscious professionals (25-55 years old, $75k+ household income) who track wellness metrics, invest in preventative health, value time efficiency, and are early adopters of health technology
- **Secondary:** People with dexterity issues (elderly, arthritis), dental-phobic individuals seeking to improve oral health at home, busy parents wanting thorough cleaning for children
- **Decision Makers:** Individual consumers making personal health investments; may also appeal to wellness-focused households making family health decisions

### Current Market Gap
Feno fills the gap between traditional electric toothbrushes (time-consuming, technique-dependent, no health monitoring) and basic U-shaped brushes (lack quality and monitoring features). Feno is the only toothbrush that combines time-efficient full-mouth cleaning with AI-powered health monitoring, creating a new subcategory: "health monitoring smartbrush" rather than just "better toothbrush."

## Feno Smartbrush – The Flagship Product

### Product Description
The Feno Smartbrush is a revolutionary oral care system that combines a U-shaped mouthpiece with 18,000 precision nylon bristles for simultaneous full-mouth cleaning in 20 seconds, plus a built-in AI-powered oral scanner that monitors teeth, gums, tongue, and soft tissue to provide personalized health insights and early disease detection.

### Key Features
1. **20-Second Full-Mouth Clean:** U-shaped mouthpiece with 18,000 nylon bristles (7x more than standard brushes) delivers 250 brush strokes simultaneously to all teeth, saving 21 hours per year
2. **Built-In Oral Scanner:** AI-powered camera scans teeth, gums, tongue, and soft tissue for real-time health analysis and trend tracking
3. **AI Health Monitoring:** Feno Plus app provides personalized insights, links oral health to systemic disease risk (heart disease, diabetes), and offers early detection of inflammation/decay
4. **TrueFit Mouthpiece:** Personalized sizing based on individual dental arch for optimal fit and cleaning coverage
5. **99% Plaque Removal:** Near-complete plaque removal in 3 days (per internal studies) through comprehensive bristle coverage and ArcFlow Tech

### Product Design
- **Design elements:** Sleek, modern smarthandle with magnetic wireless charging base; U-shaped mouthpiece with precision-arranged nylon bristles; minimal controls (one-button operation)
- **Materials:** Medical-grade nylon bristles, food-safe silicone mouthpiece, premium plastic handle with turquoise accent details
- **Aesthetics:** Clean, minimalist industrial design with tech-forward aesthetic (Apple meets healthcare); turquoise brand accent color on charging base; professional, clinical appearance that signals premium quality
