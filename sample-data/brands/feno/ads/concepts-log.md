# Feno SmartBrush — Concepts Log

## Ad #1: Health Blind Spot (2026-02-16)
| Level | Field |
|-------|-------|
| **L1: Angle** | You track everything except your mouth |
| **L2: Format Category** | Borrowed Interface |
| **L3: Execution** | Health app dashboard with "Oral Health: No Data" card highlighted in orange |
| **L3: Product position** | Center-bottom, hand-held |
| **L3: Product shot** | Hand-held, dynamic angle |
| **L3: Background** | Dark gradient (#0a0a17 to #1a1a2e) |

### Learnings
- Borrowed interface (health app) format works well for Feno because the product IS a health monitoring device
- Orange accent on the "No Data" card creates strong focal point against dark background
- Hand-held product photo at bottom grounds the ad and provides clear CTA connection
